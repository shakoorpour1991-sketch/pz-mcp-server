# Modding - Build 42

*Source: PZwiki — https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Modding*

Modding is the process of creating new content by creating mods for a game. For Project Zomboid, modding is a natively integrated part of the game with a mod manager and an API to allow modders to create a various quantity of content, from simple items to complex systems. Mods are usually uploaded to the Spiffo's Workshop which serves as the official method for sharing mods with the community.

## Latest information on MP unstable release

_Main article: TIS Modding Guides_

_Last updated: 11th of December 2025_

The Indie Stone has recently released an _unstable_ version of Project Zomboid which adds back multiplayer in the game. They provided the modding community with modding instructions to applying the new networking changes to existing mods that you can find here. If you don't have a TIS Forum account to download them, you find copies of these files here.

## Terms & Conditions

By playing Project Zomboid, you agree to the **Terms & Conditions**.

By modding Project Zomboid, you also agree with the **Modding Policy**.

### Key restrictions

* The Indie Stone reserves the right to implement any features in the game, irrespective of whether mods exist that accomplish the same goal.
* Modders are solely responsible for their mod, including (but not limited to) compliance with any hosting platforms (such as Steam Workshop). They are also responsible for obtaining third party consents for any third party materials in the mod. Legally, we have to ask that modders to ‘represent and warrant’ (i.e., promise legally) that their mod is their own original work and any third party contents are fully and properly licensed by the modder.
* Creation of mods is subject to our modding policy, which may be updated from time to time with any technical requirements regarding how PZ mods must work.
* Project Zomboid modders are free to receive monetary/gift donations from the players who use their releases, and appreciate the time and effort put into them. However, having mods created exclusively for those who choose to donate (or separate ‘in-mod’ content and bonuses) is not allowed. Mod creators cannot sell modifications to Project Zomboid.

## Commissions

Modders may choose to provide their skills and services through commissions, but with that comes a lot of responsibility.

If you're instead looking to commission work (have a mod made), and need advice, see Commissioning Mods.

As per the official Terms & Conditions (Section 2.4. Commercialisation) modders are in fact allowed to sell their services / create commissioned work, provided access to the mod and its content is not sold on an individual basis.

The advice below is not part of the TOS, nor legal advice, merely points to consider before going forward as a modder-for-hire:

* You should learn the ins and outs of modding before offering your services. The Zomboid API is fairly unique/niche.
* Have a portfolio ready to show. This can be as simple as your workshop page, and help build trust.
* Maintain transparency with pricing, timelines, and deliverables. Miscommunications cost time.
* Requesting payment upfront might appear to safeguard your time but it also comes with a lot more responsibility.

## Communities

Different communities exist to get help with modding, be it installing or debugging mod problems or creating mods, maps, tiles, etc.:

* Official Discord – check out the **Workshop** category to get help on installing mods, problems with mods, or developing mods.
* PZ Modding Community – provides help on coding, modeling, animating and more.
* Unofficial PZ Mapping Discord – provides help on mapping and tile making.
* Unofficial PZ Cinematic Animation Discord - provides help on cinematic animations and renders.
