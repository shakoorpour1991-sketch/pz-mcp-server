# attachment

Soft Override  
Unknown

Defines an attachment point on a
[model](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/model.html)
or
[vehicle](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/vehicle.html)
block. The ID is the attachment name, it can be a custom ID or an
existing one often used to define specific attachments. While manually
modifying the attachment block is definitely possible, it is recommended
to use the [attachment
editor](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Attachment_Editor) to create and edit
those attachments.

The syntax of this block should be as follows:

``` cpp
model upperScriptDefinition
{
    ...
    attachment attachmentPointName
    {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

For example:

``` cpp
model Burger
{
    mesh = Burger,

    attachment Bip01_Prop2
    {
        offset = 0.0142 0.0401 0.0000,
        rotate = -23.3606 21.2788 37.5386,
        scale = 0.8280,
    }
}
```
