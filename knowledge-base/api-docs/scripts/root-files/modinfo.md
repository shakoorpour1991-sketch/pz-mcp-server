by commas but no convention exists.

#### category

#### description

[ISRichTextPanel](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/ISRichTextPanel) tags. A
translation can be provided in the [Mod.json translation
file](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Translation).

#### icon

Type  
string

Image which will be used in the mod manager to put next to the name of
the mod in the list of available mods. This image will be small and
while you can use a full image size, you do not need it. You can set
your poster as the icon too to not ship two images if desired.

#### id

Type  
string

The unique identifier of the mod, used in a mod list of the user or
servers to activate the mod. Make sure to use something unique which
isn't shared between mods.

**Note:** This is not the same as the [Workshop
ID](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Workshop_ID).

#### incompatible

Type  
string

Mods that cannot be enabled at the same time as this mod. When enabled,
the other mods will be unselectable. This mod will also become
unselectable if any of the other mods are enabled.

Example:

``` 
incompatible=theUnwantedMod,theOtherOne
```

#### loadModAfter

Type  
string

Loads the mod only after the set of mods listed.

Example:

``` 
loadModAfter=someMod,anotherMod
```

#### loadModBefore

Type  
string

Loads the mod before the set of mods listed.

``` 
loadModBefore=someMod,anotherMod
```

#### modversion

Type  
string

Version of the mod.

#### name

Type  
string

The displayed name for your mod in the game's mod manager. A translation
can be provided in the [Mod.json translation
file](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Translation).

#### pack

Type  
string

Name of pack files that need to be loaded by the game. Notably used for
[Texture pack](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Texture_pack) and [Tile
pack](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Mapping).

#### poster

Type  
string

Image which will show up in the mod manager as the mod image. Multiple
posters can be used to show multiple images, but the first one will be
used as the main poster in the mod manager. The rest will be in a list
of images of the mod that users can click on to view.

Example:

``` 
poster=poster.png
poster=showcase.png
poster=flying_chickens.png
poster=credits.png
```

If you have multiple versions of your mod (e.g., 42.12 and 42.13) and
don't want to copy your images, you can leave them in the common folder
and use the following (but use unique names for these images since it
will use the pool of all mods and their images in the common folder):

``` 
poster=../common/mymodname_poster.png
poster=../common/mymodname_showcase.png
poster=../common/mymodname_flying_chickens.png
poster=../common/mymodname_credits.png
```

#### require

Type  
string

Mods required to run this mod. Multiple mods can be specified separated
by commas.

Example:

``` 
require=theNeededMod,theOtherOne
```

#### tiledef

string

Name of the tiledef with its ID that are added by the mod. You can find
a community managed list of already used tiledef IDs in [Tiledefs used
by mods](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Tiledefs_used_by_mods).

Example:

``` 
tiledef=Excavation 2112
```

If you upload your mod with a new tiledef ID, you can update the list to
reduce the chance of incompatibility with other mods adding tile packs.

#### url

Type  
string

Shows a URL link in the mod manager on the page of your mod for users to
click on to open in their internet browser. The parameter appears as
"Homepage" in the mod manager. For a list of valid links, see
[URL](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/URL).

#### versionMax

string

The maximum version of the game the mod can be used on. This number
needs to be in the format `build.major` at the very least, and not just
`build` or it won't work. Example `42.12`.

#### versionMin

Type  
string

The minimum version of the game the mod can be used on. This number
needs to be in the format `build.major` at the very least, and not just
`build` or it won't work. Example `42.0`.
