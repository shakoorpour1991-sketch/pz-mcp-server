# rule

Soft Override  
Unknown

No comma  
True

A `rule` block defines a conversion rule for the [BMP to
TMX](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/BMP_to_TMX) conversion process in the
[mapping tools](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Mapping#Mapping_tools). It is
used to associate a color on the BMP for the vegetation or main image to
a list of tiles to apply on a specific layer in the TMX.

For example:

``` cpp
rule
{
  label = Sand
  bitmap = 0
  color = 210 200 160
  tiles = sand
  layer = 0_Floor
}
```

## Hierarchy

This block can be a child of the following blocks:

- ROOT-Rules

## ID

This block should have no ID.

## Parameters

#### bitmap

Type  
integer

A value of `1` will have this rule used for the vegetation image, while
a value of `0` will have it used for the main tiles image. Trees will
for example use `1` while ground tiles will use `0`.

#### color

Type  
array (array of integer, separator: ' ')

The RGB color to replace with the tiles in the `tiles` parameter. This
is the color you painted in your image file to associate to this rule.

#### label

Type  
string

No description provided.

#### layer

Type  
string

The layer to apply the tiles on.

#### tiles

Type  
Unknown

A list of tiles to apply randomly for this color. You can also use an
alias block here to reference a list of tiles.

For example:

``` cpp
tiles = vegetation_farm_01_35
```

``` cpp
tiles = [
    vegetation_farm_01_32
    vegetation_farm_01_33
    vegetation_farm_01_34
    vegetation_farm_01_35
    vegetation_farm_01_36
    vegetation_farm_01_37
    vegetation_farm_01_38
    vegetation_farm_01_39
]
```

Or with one or more alias blocks:

``` cpp
alias
{
    name = treez1
    tiles = [
        vegetation_trees_01_13
        vegetation_trees_01_14
        vegetation_trees_01_15
        vegetation_trees_01_8
        vegetation_trees_01_9
        vegetation_trees_01_10
        vegetation_trees_01_11
        vegetation_trees_01_17
    ]
}
```

``` cpp
tiles = [
  treez1
]
```
