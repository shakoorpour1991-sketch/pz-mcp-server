# timedAction

Soft Override  
Unknown

The timedAction script block is used to define an action which can be
used in
[craftRecipes](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html).
You can specify the animation played, props in hands during the action,
the sound played. Also define its impact on the player character,
including effects on calories burned and body heat generation.

Below are a few examples of `timedAction` blocks from the vanilla game:

``` cpp
timedAction UseLathe
{
    metabolics      = Default,
    actionAnim      = UseLathe,
}
```

``` cpp
timedAction BuildCairn
{
    metabolics      = HeavyWork,
    actionAnim      = Loot,
    animVarKey      = LootPosition,
    animVarVal      = Low,
    sound           = BuildingGeneric,
    completionSound = BuildFenceCairn,
    muscleStrainFactor = 0.0025,
    muscleStrainSkill = Strength,
    muscleStrainParts = Neck,
}
```

``` cpp
timedAction BuildBarbedWireFence
{
    metabolics      = HeavyWork,
    actionAnim      = Loot,
    animVarKey      = LootPosition,
    animVarVal      = Low,
    sound           = BuildingGeneric,
    completionSound = BuildMetalStructureSmallWiredFence,
}
```

## Hierarchy

This block can be a child of the following blocks:

- [module](./module.md)

## ID

This block can have an ID.

Optional  
False

Can have spaces  
False

## Parameters

#### actionAnim

Type  
string

The actionAnim parameter is used to define the animation played during a
timed action. It links to a
[PerformingAction](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/PerformingAction) define in
the action [AnimSets](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/AnimSet) of the player.

#### animVarKey

Type  
Unknown

The
[animVarKey](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/timedaction.html#animVarKey)
and
[animVarVal](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/timedaction.html#animVarVal)
parameters are used together to link to a specific [AnimNode
Conditions](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Conditions). `animVarKey` will
correspond to the `m_Name` field and `animVarVal` to the `m_Value`
field.

This allows for easy swapping between variants of
[actionAnim](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/timedaction.html#actionAnim).
For example, for the AnimNode:

``` cpp
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<animNode x_extends="Loot.xml">
  <m_Name>LootHigh</m_Name>
  <m_AnimName>Bob_IdleLooting_High</m_AnimName>
  <m_Conditions />
  <m_Conditions />
  <m_Conditions>
    <m_Name>LootPosition</m_Name>
    <m_Type>STRING</m_Type>
    <m_StringValue>High</m_StringValue>
  </m_Conditions>
</animNode>
```

You can define those parameters in the timedAction as follows:

``` cpp
actionAnim      = Loot,
animVarKey      = LootPosition,
animVarVal      = Low,
```

#### animVarVal

Type  
Unknown

See parameter animVarKey.

#### completionSound

Type  
block (block: [sound](./sound.md))

Defines the sound played at the end of the action.

#### metabolics

Type  
Unknown

The metabolics parameter is used to define the impact of the action on
the player character's metabolics, such as the calories burn rate or
body heat generation. It uses predefined enumeration values to specify
the multiplier on the metabolism. You can find a list of metabolic types
and their associated values in the
[Metabolics](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/java/metabolics.html)
documentation.

#### muscleStrainFactor

Type  
Unknown

Muscle strain is an effect which applies to the character limbs,
simulating the fatigue and strain of performing certain actions. A
timedAction script can be set to apply muscle strain to specific limbs
and based on the level of the character in a specific skill.

[muscleStrainFactor](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/timedaction.html#muscleStrainFactor)
serves as a parameter of how much muscle strain will be gained.

[muscleStrainParts](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/timedaction.html#muscleStrainParts)
will indicate the limbs affected by the muscle strain, which needs to be
an array of
[BodyPartType](https://demiurgequantified.github.io/ProjectZomboidJavaDocs/zombie/characters/BodyDamage/BodyPartType.html#enum-constant-summary).

If
[muscleStrainSkill](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/timedaction.html#muscleStrainSkill)
is provided, the skill will be used to reduce the muscle strain when the
player gets better at something.

``` 
strain = deltaTime * muscleStrainFactor * (1 - skillLevel * 0.5)
```

#### muscleStrainParts

Type  
array (array of string, separator: ';')

See parameter
muscleStrainFactor.

#### muscleStrainSkill

Type  
Unknown

See parameter
muscleStrainFactor.

#### prop1

Type  
block (block: [model](./model.md), with `scripts-module`)

No description provided.

#### prop2

Type  
block (block: [model](./model.md), with `scripts-module`)

No description provided.

#### sound

Type  
block (block: [sound](./sound.md))

Defines the sound played during the action.

#### soundTime

Type  
string

Is useless  
True

Default  
`action_start`

This parameter is used in the Lua to indicate when the sound should be
played during the timed action. This is notably used to play a sound at
the end or the start of the action during
[crafting](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftRecipe.html#timedAction).

By itself, this doesn't do anything and requires implementation in
[Lua](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Lua_(API)). For example inside
`ISHandcraftAction`.
