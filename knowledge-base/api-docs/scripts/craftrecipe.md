# craftRecipe

Soft Override  
True

The 'craftRecipe' script block is used to define a crafting recipe,
which allows players to craft items or tiles in the game based on the
parent script block. For example, a craftRecipe defined inside a
[module](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/module.html)
will be a recipe to craft an item usually, while when defined inside an
[entity](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/entity.html)
it will be the building recipe for that entity.

A craftRecipe will usually require an
[inputs](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/inputs.html)
and
[outputs](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/outputs.html)
block. Other parameters are used to define properties of this recipe,
such as the
[time](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#time)
it takes to craft or the [XP
awarded](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#xpaward)
for crafting it.

For example:

``` java
module yourModule /* or Base */
{
    craftRecipe yourRecipeID
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

Some methods to modify existing recipes are documented on the
[wiki](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/CraftRecipe#Modifying_existing_recipes).

To define a translation for this recipe, you need to create an entry in
the translation file
[Recipes.json](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/translations/translation_files.html#recipes).
The translation entry should be formatted like this:

``` json
{
  "yourRecipeID": "Your recipe"
}
```

Notice how you shouldn't use the
[module](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/module.html)
in the translation file key and only the craftRecipe ID.

Here's an example of a craftRecipe with some parameters defined:

``` java
craftRecipe SawLogs
{
    timedAction = SawLogs,
    Time = 230,
    Tags = InHandCraft;CanBeDoneFromFloor,
    category = Carpentry,
    xpAward = Woodwork:5,
    inputs
    {
        item 1 [Base.Log] flags[Prop2],
        item 1 tags[Saw] mode:keep flags[MayDegradeLight;Prop1],
    }
    outputs
    {
        item 3 Base.Plank,
    }
}
```

Or:

``` java
craftRecipe CarveWhistle
{
    time = 200,
    tags = AnySurfaceCraft;Survivalist,
    category = Carving,
    xpAward = Carving:60,
    SkillRequired = Carving:6,
    needTobeLearn = true,
    AutoLearnAny = Carving:8,
    timedAction = SharpenStake,
    inputs
    {
        item 1 tags[DrillWood;DrillMetal;DrillWoodPoor] mode:keep flags[MayDegradeLight],
        item 1 tags[SharpKnife] mode:keep flags[MayDegradeLight],
        item 1 [Base.SmallAnimalBone] flags[Prop2;AllowDestroyedItem],
    }
    outputs
    {
        item 1 Base.Whistle_Bone,
    }
}
```

And a more advanced one:

``` java
craftRecipe RefillHurricaneLantern
{
    timedAction = Making,
    Time = 50,
    OnCreate = Recipe.OnCreate.RefillHurricaneLantern,
    /* OnTest = Recipe.OnTest.RefillHurricaneLantern, */
    Tags = InHandCraft;CanBeDoneInDark,
    category = Miscellaneous, /*category = Survival,*/
    inputs
    {
        item 1 [Base.Lantern_Hurricane;Base.Lantern_Hurricane_Copper;Base.Lantern_Hurricane_Forged;Base.Lantern_Hurricane_Gold;Base.Lantern_Hurricane_Silver] mode:destroy flags[NotFull;AllowFavorite;InheritFavorite;ItemCount] mappers[LampMapper],
        item 1 [*],
        -fluid 1.0 [Petrol],
    }
    outputs
    {
        item 1 mapper:LampMapper,
    }
    itemMapper LampMapper
    {
        Base.Lantern_Hurricane = Base.Lantern_Hurricane,
        Base.Lantern_Hurricane_Copper = Base.Lantern_Hurricane_Copper,
        Base.Lantern_Hurricane_Forged = Base.Lantern_Hurricane_Forged,
        Base.Lantern_Hurricane_Gold = Base.Lantern_Hurricane_Gold,
        Base.Lantern_Hurricane_Silver = Base.Lantern_Hurricane_Silver,

        default = Base.Lantern_Hurricane,
    }
}
```

- [overlayMapper](./overlaymapper.md)
- [outputs](./outputs.md)

## ID

This block can have an ID.

Optional  
False

Can have spaces  
False

## Parameters

#### AllowBatchCraft

Type  
boolean

Default  
`True`

The AllowBatchCraft parameter is used to allow the recipe to be crafted
in batches. This will make a slider appear on the crafting to craft
multiple ones at once. Needs to be a boolean and default is `true`, set
to `false` to disable batch craft.

#### Animation

Type  
string

Is useless  
True

No description provided.

#### AutoLearnAll

Type  
object (object: string-\>\>integer, kv: ':', pairs: ';')

The
[AutoLearnAll](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#autolearnall)
parameter specifies that all the provided skills and their associated
level need to be reached to automatically learn the recipe. On the other
hand,
[AutoLearnAny](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#autolearnany)
specifies that at least one of the skills and its associated level need
to be reached to automatically learn the recipe. Both can also be used
together.

Both parameters should be formatted this way:

``` java
/* a single skill */
autoLearnAll = <skill name>:<level amount>,

/* multiple skills */
autoLearnAll = <skill1 name>:<level amount>;<skill2 name>:<level amount>,
```

For the list of available skills, see the
[wiki](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/CraftRecipe#Available_skills).

For example:

``` java
autoLearnAll = Carving:3;Maintenance:2,
```

#### AutoLearnAny

Type  
object (object: string-\>\>integer, kv: ':', pairs: ';')

See parameter AutoLearnAll.

#### CanWalk

Type  
boolean

Default  
`False`

Whether the player can walk while crafting this recipe.

#### category

Type  
translation

Default  
`Miscellaneous`

The category under which the recipe will be listed in the crafting menu.
Helps to organize and identify recipes in crafting menu. Your category
should have a key with the suffix `IGUI_CraftingCategories_` in the
[IG_UI.json](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/translations/translation_files.html#ig-ui)
translation file to be properly displayed in the crafting menu. For
example:

``` java
category = MyCategory,
```

And in the translation file:

``` json
{
  "IGUI_CraftingCategories_MyCategory": "My Category"
}
```

#### Icon

Type  
string

Specifies the icon associated with this crafting recipe. The icon needs
to be located in `media/textures`, for example
`media/textures/myIcon.png` will be refered to as `Icon = myIcon,`.

This seems to be used only once in the vanilla recipes with the entry
`Icon = Item_WaterDrop,`, as the icon usually defaults to the items that
will be crafted.

#### MetaRecipe

Type  
Unknown

A meta recipe is used to link two recipes so that if the meta recipe is
known then this recipe will be known. The opposite however is not true,
if the main recipe is known the meta recipe is not automatically known.

In this example below, the recipe `MyRecipe1` will be known if the
recipe `MyRecipe2` is known. However if the recipe `MyRecipe1` is known,
the recipe `MyRecipe2` will not automatically be known and needs to be
learnt.

``` java
craftRecipe MyRecipe1
{
    ...
}

craftRecipe MyRecipe2
{
    ...
    metaRecipe = MyRecipe1,
    ...
}
```

#### NeedToBeLearn

Type  
Unknown

Whether the recipe needs to be learned before it can be crafted.

#### OnAddToMenu

Type  
callback

Called when the recipe gets added to the recipe menu. Return `true` to
add it, and return `false` to stop it from getting added to the menu.

#### OnCreate

Type  
callback

Various callback functions can be added to a recipe to trigger at
specific moments during the crafting process:

- [OnCreate](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#oncreate)
  is called when the crafting recipe is finished.
- [OnTest](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#ontest)
  is called to verify if the item can be used in the recipe.
- [OnFailed](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#onfailed)
  is called when the crafting recipe fails or is canceled.
- [OnUpdate](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#onupdate)
  is called every tick while the recipe is being crafted.

The callback needs to be a Lua function defined as a [global
function](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Lua_(language)\#Local_and_global),
which can also be stored in a global table. The vanilla game OnCreate's
are stored in the [Java](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Java).

For example, for
[OnCreate](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#oncreate)
you should have the following structure:

``` lua
---@param craftRecipeData CraftRecipeData
---@param character IsoGameCharacter
function MyOnCreateFunction(craftRecipeData, character)
    -- your custom code here
end
```

The `craftRecipeData` is a [java
object](https://demiurgequantified.github.io/ProjectZomboidJavaDocs/zombie/entity/components/crafting/recipe/CraftRecipeData.html)
that contains the data of the crafting recipe. The `character` is the
player character who is crafting the recipe.

For
[OnTest](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#ontest)
you should have the following structure:

``` lua
---@param item InventoryItem
---@param character IsoGameCharacter
---@return boolean logicTestResult
function MyOnTestFunction(item, character)
    -- your custom code here
    return logicTestResult  -- based on your logic test above
end
```

#### OnFailed

Type  
callback

See parameter OnCreate.

#### OnTest

Type  
callback

See parameter OnCreate.

#### OnUpdate

Type  
callback

See parameter OnCreate.

#### overlayStyle

Type  
Unknown

No description provided.

#### recipeGroup

Type  
Unknown

No description provided.

#### ResearchAll

Type  
Unknown

See parameter
ResearchSkillLevel.

#### ResearchAny

Type  
Unknown

See parameter
ResearchSkillLevel.

#### ResearchSkillLevel

Type  
integer

Default  
`-1`

[ResearchSkillLevel](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#researchskilllevel)
is used to define the skill level required for
[ResearchAll](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#researchall)
and
[ResearchAny](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#researchany)
to be able to research the recipe. Having the [inventive
trait](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Inventive) will lower the required level
by 2.

[ResearchAll](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#researchall)
will require all the provided skills to be at least the required level,
while
[ResearchAny](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/craftrecipe.html#researchany)
will require only one or more of the provided skills.

#### SkillRequired

Type  
object (object: string-\>\>integer, kv: ':', pairs: ';')

Specifies the skill level required to perform this crafting action. It
should be formatted this way:

``` java
/* a single skill */
skillRequired = <skill name>:<level>,

/* multiple skills */
skillRequired = <skill1 name>:<level>;<skill2 name>:<level>,
```

For the list of available skills, see the
[wiki](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/CraftRecipe#Available_skills).

For example:

``` java
skillRequired = Blacksmith:3;Tailoring:2,
```

#### tags

Type  
array (array of string, separator: ';')

Required  
True

Specifies specific conditions which need to be respected to craft this
item. At least one crafting bench tag is necessary for the craft to be
recognized, such as `AnySurfaceCraft`. The syntax is as follows:

``` java
/* single tag */
Tags = tag1,

/* multiple tags */
Tags = tag1;tag2;...,
```

For example:

``` java
Tags = InHandCraft;CanAlwaysBeResearched,
```

A crafting bench tag can be created by adding a [component
CraftBench](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/component/component-craftbench.html)
to an
[entity](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/entity.html)
script, which can then be used in this tags parameter.

You can find a list of tags available on the
[wiki](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/CraftRecipe#List_of_tags).

#### time

Type  
integer

Default  
`50`

The time it takes to craft the item, not using a specific unit of time
so refer to the vanilla recipes to get an idea of what value to use.

#### timedAction

Type  
block (block: [timedAction](./timedaction.md))

Refers to a timed action script block to trigger during the crafting
process, for animations and/or sounds but also the calories burned and
body heat generation.

#### Tooltip

Type  
translation

Description of the crafting which is shown in the crafting menu. The
value needs be a key in the
[Tooltip.json](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/translations/translation_files.html#tooltip)
translation file. For example:

``` java
Tooltip = MyTooltipKey,
```

And in the translation file:

``` json
{
  "MyTooltipKey": "This is my tooltip description."
}
```

#### xpAward

Type  
Unknown

Specifies the experience points awarded for crafting this item. The
parameter should be formatted this way:

``` java
/* a single skill */
xpAward = <skill name>:<xp amount>,

/* multiple skills */
xpAward = <skill1 name>:<xp amount>;<skill2 name>:<xp amount>,format
```

For the list of available skills, see the
[wiki](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/CraftRecipe#Available_skills).

For example:

``` java
xpAward = Blacksmith:10;Tailoring:5,
```
