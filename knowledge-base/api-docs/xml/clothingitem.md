# clothingItem

Clothing items are first defined with an
[item](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/item.html)
script block, but a lot of their properties are defined in the clothing
item XML files. Some of these properties include masks, textures,
shaders, and models. The clothing items are linked to these files via
the
[GUID](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-guid)
parameter.

The clothing item XML files need to be stored in the path
`media/clothing/clothingItems/` for the game to recognize them.

## File Patterns

The following file patterns are used to determine what the valid path
for the XML file can be, relative to the
[media](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Mod_structure#Media_folder) folder.

- `**/clothing/clothingItems/**/*.xml`

## Root Details

Element  
clothingItem

The root element is the top-level XML element that contains all other
elements in the XML file.

### Elements

#### m_MaleModel

Minimum occurence  
1

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:string`

The
[m_MaleModel](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-malemodel)
and
[m_FemaleModel](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-femalemodel)
are used to specify what model file will be used for the clothing item.
Those parameters **should** be left empty when the clothing item is a
body texture.

The model file are accessed relatively to the parent folder of
[media](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Mod_structure#Media_folder) and relative
to the models_X folder, but preferably should be stored in
`media/models_X` and accessed relative to it.

For example, for the following file structure:

``` 
📁 media
  📁 models_X
    📁 MyAwesomeClothing
      📄 myClothing.fbx
```

These parameters should have this following syntax:

``` 
<m_MaleModel>MyAwesomeClothing/myClothing</m_MaleModel>
```

The path separators can be either unix with `/` or `\\`, both are valid.
Make sure to not add the extension.

[m_AltMaleModel](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-altmalemodel)
and
[m_AltFemaleModel](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-altfemalemodel)
are used to define alternative models for clothing items that share the
same
[BodyLocation](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/item.html#bodylocation)
slot as another clothing item. Alternative models relationship between
BodyLocations are set in the Lua (in
`media/lua/shared/NPCs/BodyLocations.lua` for the vanilla game).

#### m_FemaleModel

The model file are accessed relatively to the parent folder of
[media](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Mod_structure#Media_folder) and relative
to the models_X folder, but preferably should be stored in
`media/models_X` and accessed relative to it.

For example, for the following file structure:

``` 
📁 media
  📁 models_X
    📁 MyAwesomeClothing
      📄 myClothing.fbx
```

These parameters should have this following syntax:

```

and
[m_AltFemaleModel](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-altfemalemodel)
are used to define alternative models for clothing items that share the
same
[BodyLocation](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/item.html#bodylocation)
slot as another clothing item. Alternative models relationship between
BodyLocations are set in the Lua (in

`media/lua/shared/NPCs/BodyLocations.lua` for the vanilla game).

#### m_GUID

Minimum occurence  
1

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:string`

The [GUID](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/GUID) of the clothing item. This
needs to be the same as the one inside the
[fileGuidTable](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/fileGuidTable.html#guid)
file for the clothing item to be recognized by the game.

#### m_Static

Minimum occurence  
1

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:boolean`

If `true`, the clothing item won't deform with the character's body.
This is used for items like backpacks or hats that should not change
shape with the character's body.

#### m_AllowRandomHue

Minimum occurence  
1

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:boolean`

When
[m_AllowRandomHue](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-allowrandomhue)
or
[m_AllowRandomTint](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-allowrandomtint)
are set to `true`, the clothing item will respectively have a random hue
or tint applied to it. m_AllowRandomHue doesn't seem to be impactful on
the clothing item as much as m_AllowRandomTint, which will apply the
random color on white areas of the clothing item.

#### m_AllowRandomTint

Minimum occurence  
1

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:boolean`

When
[m_AllowRandomHue](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-allowrandomhue)
or
[m_AllowRandomTint](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-allowrandomtint)
are set to `true`, the clothing item will respectively have a random hue
or tint applied to it. m_AllowRandomHue doesn't seem to be impactful on
the clothing item as much as m_AllowRandomTint, which will apply the
random color on white areas of the clothing item.

#### m_AttachBone

Minimum occurence  
1

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:string`

Specifies a bone to attach the clothing item to. Mostly notably used for
hats and some arm protection items. To attach to the head, use
`Bip01_Head`.

#### m_Shader

Minimum occurence  
1

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:string`

Specifies a shader to use for the clothing item. The default shader used
by clothing items is `basicEffect`. The value needs to be the filename
of the shader inside the folder `media/shaders`.

#### textureChoices

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
unbounded

Type  
`xs:string`

[textureChoices](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#texturechoices)
sets the texture used by the clothing item. Many of those can be
provided as random choices for the clothing item. The textures need to
be stored in the folder `media/textures`.

For example, for the following file structure:

``` 
📁 media
  📁 textures
    📁 CoolMod
      📄 texture1.png
      📄 texture2.png
```

You'd have:

``` xml
<textureChoices>CoolMod/texture1</textureChoices>
<textureChoices>CoolMod/texture2</textureChoices>
```

[m_BaseTextures](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-basetextures)
is used specifically for 2D clothing items that are applied on the
character's body directly (tshirts, pants, socks...). The folder
structure is the same as for
[textureChoices](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#texturechoices).

#### m_BaseTextures

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
unbounded

Type  
`xs:string`

[textureChoices](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#texturechoices)
sets the texture used by the clothing item. Many of those can be
provided as random choices for the clothing item. The textures need to
be stored in the folder `media/textures`.

For example, for the following file structure:

``` 
📁 media
  📁 textures
    📁 CoolMod
      📄 texture1.png
      📄 texture2.png
```

You'd have:

``` xml
<textureChoices>CoolMod/texture1</textureChoices>
<textureChoices>CoolMod/texture2</textureChoices>
```

[m_BaseTextures](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-basetextures)
is used specifically for 2D clothing items that are applied on the
character's body directly (tshirts, pants, socks...). The folder
structure is the same as for
[textureChoices](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#texturechoices).

#### m_Masks

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
unbounded

Type  
`xs:integer`

[m_Masks](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-masks)
when set to a specific integer value will hide specific elements of the
character's body model. This is notably used to remove clipping with
body parts that are hidden by the clothing item. For example, a jacket
will hide the torso and arms, so to reduce risks of clipping you may
want to hide these.

You can find a list of the values and their corresponding body parts in
the Project Zomboid Modding Archives
[here](https://github.com/PZ-Wiki-Modding/Archive.Project-Zomboid-Modding/blob/main/Clothing/Masks/Mask.png).

You can insert as many of these as you want, for example:

``` xml
<m_Masks>12</m_Masks>
<m_Masks>13</m_Masks>
<m_Masks>14</m_Masks>
<m_Masks>3</m_Masks>
<m_Masks>5</m_Masks>
```

[m_UnderlayMasksFolder](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-underlaymasksfolder)
supposedly is used to add a texture folder in which you have modified
versions of these masks if you ever need to adjust the masks for your
own clothing items without clashing with other mods custom masks.

#### m_MasksFolder

Minimum occurence  
1

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:string`

Default value is `media/textures/Body/Masks`. Some clothing behaviors
seem to be hardcoded to this path. You can notably use it to deactivate
masks by setting the value to `media/textures/Clothes/Hat/Masks`, but it
will also deactivate damage (holes) and blood effects.

#### m_UnderlayMasksFolder

Minimum occurence  
1

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:string`

Default value is `media/textures/Body/UnderlayMasks`. Some clothing
behaviors seem to be hardcoded to this path.

#### m_HatCategory

Minimum occurence  
1

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:string`

Seems to be used to specify if a hat will hide the hair and beard.
Notable values are:

- `default`
- `nohairnobeard`
- `nobeard`
- `nohair`

Then values `Group` followed by a number `01`, `02`, etc are also used.

#### m_SpawnWith

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
unbounded

Type  
`xs:string`

Link to other items that this clothingItem should spawn with. This is
for example used to make left and right elbow pads spawn together. The
value needs to be the
[GUID](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-guid)
of the other clothing item.

To add multiple items, you can add multiple `<m_SpawnWith>` elements:

``` xml
<m_SpawnWith>GUID1</m_SpawnWith>
<m_SpawnWith>GUID2</m_SpawnWith>
<m_SpawnWith>GUID3</m_SpawnWith>
...
```

#### m_DecalGroup

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:string`

Refers to the
[name](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingDecals.html#name)
parameter of a decal group defined in the
[clothingDecals.xml](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingDecals.html)
file. The clothing decals are used to add additional textures on top of
the clothing item. This is most notably used to add logos on t-shirts,
and it is possible to add multiple logos on a single decal group.
