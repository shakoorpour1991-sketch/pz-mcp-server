# clothingDecals

Define decal groups for clothing items to use. Seems to be only used for
shirts in the vanilla game and it is unknown if they can be used for
other clothing items. The decal groups are linked to clothing items via
the
[m_DecalGroup](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-decalgroup)
parameter. They can also be linked to other decal groups via the
[group](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingDecals.html#group)
parameter, allowing a decal group to use decals from another decal
group.

The file needs to exactly stored at the path
`media/clothing/clothingDecals.xml` for the game to recognize it. It
won't clash with other mods or the vanilla game file. The syntax of this
file should be as follows:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<clothingDecals>
  <group>
    <name>MyDecalGroup</name>
    <decal>myDecal</decal>
    <decal>anotherDecal</decal>
  </group>
  <group>
    <name>MyOtherDecalGroup</name>
    <group>MyDecalGroup</group>
  </group>
  <group>
    <name>MyThirdDecalGroup</name>
    <decal>thirdDecal</decal>
    <group>MyOtherDecalGroup</group>
  </group>
</clothingDecals>
```

## File Patterns

The following file patterns are used to determine what the valid path
for the XML file can be, relative to the
[media](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Mod_structure#Media_folder) folder.

- `**/clothing/clothingDecals.xml`

## Root Details

Element  
clothingDecals

The root element is the top-level XML element that contains all other
elements in the XML file.

Composition  
all

### Elements

#### group

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
unbounded

Type  
type_clothingDecalGroup

Defines a decal group, that is a collection of decals associated to a
name for referencing.

## type_clothingDecalGroup

Composition  
all

### Elements

#### name

Minimum occurence  
1

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:string`

A unique identifier for the decal group.

#### decal

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
unbounded

Type  
`xs:string`

Refers to a texture file stored inside the folder
`media/textures/shirtdecals/`. The value needs to be the name of the
file without the extension (which needs to be `.png`). Alternatively, it
seems the game also accepts decals inside texture packs.

For example, for the following file structure:

``` 
📁 media
  📁 textures
    📁 shirtdecals
      📄 myDecal.png
      📄 anotherDecal.png
```

The decal parameter should have this following syntax:

``` 
<decal>myDecal</decal>
<decal>anotherDecal</decal>
```

#### group

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
unbounded

Type  
`xs:string`

Refers to another
[group](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingDecals.html#group).
This allows that group to use decals of the referenced group.
