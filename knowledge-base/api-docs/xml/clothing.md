# clothing

Define outfits for the male and female characters that can be used on
zombies or the player. Items are provided with a probability value to
define how likely they are to appear in the outfit.

The file should be stored at the exact path
`media/clothing/clothing.xml` and won't clash with other mods or the
vanilla game file. The syntax of this file should be as follows:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<outfitManager>
  <m_FemaleOutfits>
    <m_Name>MyOutfit</m_Name>
    <m_Guid>my-outfit-guid</m_Guid>
    <m_items>
      <item>
        <probability>0.5</probability>
        <itemGUID>my-clothing-item-guid</itemGUID>
      </item>
      <item>
        <probability>0.5</probability>
        <itemGUID>my-other-clothing-item-guid</itemGUID>
        <subItems>
          <subItem>
            <itemGUID>my-sub-clothing-item-guid</itemGUID>
          </subItem>
        </subItems>
      </item>
    </m_items>
  </m_MaleOutfits>
    <m_Name>MyOutfit</m_Name>
    <m_Guid>my-outfit-guid</m_Guid>
    <m_items>
      <item>
        <probability>0.5</probability>
        <itemGUID>my-clothing-item-guid</itemGUID>
      </item>
      <item>
        <probability>0.5</probability>
        <itemGUID>my-other-clothing-item-guid</itemGUID>
        <subItems>
          <subItem>
            <itemGUID>my-sub-clothing-item-guid</itemGUID>
          </subItem>
        </subItems>
      </item>
    </m_items>
  </m_MaleOutfits>
</outfitManager>
```

## File Patterns

The following file patterns are used to determine what the valid path
for the XML file can be, relative to the
[media](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Mod_structure#Media_folder) folder.

- `**/clothing/clothing.xml`

## Root Details

Element  
outfitManager

The root element is the top-level XML element that contains all other
elements in the XML file.

Composition  
all

### Elements

#### m_FemaleOutfits

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
unbounded

Type  
type_outfit

Define an outfit with
[m_FemaleOutfits](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothing.html#m-femaleoutfits)
and
[m_MaleOutfits](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothing.html#m-maleoutfits)
respectively for the female and male characters. If one of the two is
not defined, it won't spawn naturally on the other gender in the game.
Both male and female outfits can (and probably should) keep the same
[m_Name](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothing.html#m-name)
and
[m_Guid](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothing.html#m-guid)
values.

#### m_MaleOutfits

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
unbounded

Type  
type_outfit

Define an outfit with
[m_FemaleOutfits](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothing.html#m-femaleoutfits)
and
[m_MaleOutfits](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothing.html#m-maleoutfits)
respectively for the female and male characters. If one of the two is
not defined, it won't spawn naturally on the other gender in the game.
Both male and female outfits can (and probably should) keep the same
[m_Name](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothing.html#m-name)
and
[m_Guid](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothing.html#m-guid)
values.

## type_outfit

Composition  
all

### Elements

#### m_Name

Minimum occurence  
1

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:string`

The unique identifier for the outfit. Preferably keep it the same for
the male and female variants.

#### m_Guid

Minimum occurence  
1

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:string`

The [GUID](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/GUID) of the outfit. This is the GUID
associated to the clothing in the
[fileGuidTable](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/fileGuidTable.html#guid)
and
[clothingItem](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothingItem.html#m-guid)
files.

To use a vanilla clothing item in your outfit, you need to redefine it
in your own mod's fileGuidTable.xml file, otherwise the game will not
recognize it.

#### m_Top

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:boolean`

If set to `true`, the outfit will spawn with random pants or shirts,
respectivement for the parameters
[m_Pants](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothing.html#m-pants)
and
[m_Top](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/clothing.html#m-top).
When those two parameters are not set, they default to `true`.

#### m_Pants
