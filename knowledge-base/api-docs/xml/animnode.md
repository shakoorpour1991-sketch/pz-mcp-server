# animNode

The AnimNode files are used to link animation files to the game by
defining different parameters for the animation. This will notably
control the speed of the animation, its blending with animations played
before and after, events that need to be triggered and conditions that
control when that animation can be played.

## File Patterns

The following file patterns are used to determine what the valid path
for the XML file can be, relative to the
[media](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Mod_structure#Media_folder) folder.

- `**/AnimSets/**/*.xml`

## Root Details

Element  
animNode

The root element is the top-level XML element that contains all other
elements in the XML file.

### Elements

#### m_Name

Minimum occurence  
1

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:string`

A unique identifier for this animation node. For example: "LoadRiffle",
"Walk" etc. This is notably used to reference this animNode in other
animNodes.

#### m_AnimName

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:string`

Name of the animation clip to play. This is the name of the animation
file without the extension. The animation clip needs to be stored inside
the `anims_X` folder and inside a subfolder which matches the character
the animation is for. For the player, that subfolder needs to be `Bob`.

For example, take the animation file `Bob_Reload_Rifle_Load.glb` with
the following folder structure:

``` 
📁 media
  📁 anims_X
    📁 Bob
      📄 Bob_Reload_Rifle_Load.glb
```

To reference it in the animNode, you would use:

``` xml
<m_AnimName>Bob_Reload_Rifle_Load</m_AnimName>
```

#### m_BlendTime

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:float`

Defines how quickly the animation will begin to play, and how the game
interpolates moving the armature's bones from one animNode to another.

#### m_BlendOutTime

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:float`

Defines how quickly the animation will end, and how the game
interpolates moving the armature's bones from one animState to another.
It is used to create a smooth transition when the animation is stopped
or changed.

#### m_SpeedScale

Minimum occurence  
0

1

Type  
`xs:string`

Looks unused.

#### m_Looped

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:boolean`

Defines whether the animation will loop or not. If set to true, the
animation will loop indefinitely until it is manually stopped or
[conditions](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/xml/animNode.html#m-conditions)
are no longer met.

#### m_AnimReverse

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:boolean`

No description provided.

#### m_Priority

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
1

Type  
`xs:integer`

In cases of two animations that are playing at the same time, dictates
which animation's bone weights or keyframes will take precedence. An
example would be an idle animMask holding a glass which transitions into
a drinking animation. The drinking animation takes priority over the
idle drink-holding ainmMask if its priority is higher than the idle
animation mask's XML. The priority value is an integer starting at 1
with high numbers taking the priority.

#### m_ConditionPriority

#### m_Conditions

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
unbounded

Type  
type_Condition

Used to specify conditions that will allow an animation node to be
chosen. If the conditions are not met, the node will not be chosen.
These are often combined with the function
[setVariable](https://demiurgequantified.github.io/ProjectZomboidJavaDocs/zombie/characters/IsoGameCharacter.html#setVariable(java.lang.String,java.lang.String))
(which exists in many forms) to set a specific condition.

This can notably be used to trigger an animation by setting that
condition to be valid, which will make the animation node eligible to be
chosen by the game, as long as other conditions are also met.

The syntax is as follows for the most common cases:

``` xml
<m_Conditions>
  <m_Name>VariableName</m_Name>
  <m_Type>STRING</m_Type>
  <m_Value>value</m_Value>
</m_Conditions>
```

In the following example, the variable `WeaponReloadType` is set by the
game, using the parameter of the same name in the [item
script](https://pz-wiki-modding.github.io/PZ-API-Docs/scripts/item.html#item-weaponreloadtype):

``` xml
<m_Conditions>
    <m_Name>WeaponReloadType</m_Name>
    <m_Type>STRING</m_Type>
    <m_Value>revolver</m_Value>
</m_Conditions>
```

#### m_Events

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence

Type  
type_Events

Used to trigger different events during the animation at specific
moments. This can be used to play sounds, set variables, and more. You
can find a list of available events
[here](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Events#Available_events).

#### m_Transitions

Type

No description provided.

#### m_SubStateBoneWeights

Minimum occurence  
0

Maximum occurence  
unbounded

Type  
type_SubStateBoneWeights

Used to define the weight of a bone and its keyframes or descendants. By
default, all bones that are not defined with this parameter have a
default weight of `1`. If you wanted to make it so an animation were to
only play a specific set of bones; you would define the Dummy01 or the
Bip01 bones (the parent armature bones) to have a weight of 0, and then
specifically define all the bones you wish to play to have a weight
value greater than 0.

#### x_extends
