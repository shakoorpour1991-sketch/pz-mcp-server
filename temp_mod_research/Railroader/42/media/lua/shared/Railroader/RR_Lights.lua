-- Railroader / RR_Lights  -- locomotive lighting model (Task 1.K), PURE
--
-- What a GP7/GP10 actually carried, and what we reproduce:
--   * HEADLIGHT, one per END (the loco is bidirectional): a Pyle-National case with
--     TWO sealed beams, wired across the ~74 V bus. Three-position switch
--     OFF / DIM / BRIGHT -- "dim" is a real running position (meeting a train at
--     night so you don't blind the other crew, and yard work), not just "half off".
--     Only the LEADING end burns; the trailing one is switched off by the crew.
--   * NUMBER BOARDS: the lit boxes carrying the road number ("800"), backlit by
--     small incandescents. On whenever the loco is working.
--   * CAB LIGHT: dome light. Deliberately NOT on while running at night -- the crew
--     keeps the cab dark to see out -- so it's a separate switch, off by default.
--   * CLASS LIGHTS: deliberately absent. GP7s had them (white/green/red lenses for
--     train class), but the signalling practice died in the '60s and the Paducah GP10
--     rebuilds plated them over.
--   * DITCH LIGHTS: deliberately absent. Not required in the US until the 1996-97 FRA
--     rule; the game is July 1993. A K&L GP10 would not have them.
--
-- POWER (this is the whole gameplay hook): the bus is the BATTERY, topped up by an
-- auxiliary generator off the prime mover. So -- exactly like the vanilla car --
-- lights are FREE while the engine runs (the generator carries them) and eat the
-- BATTERY when it doesn't. Leave the headlight on in a parked loco and you come back
-- to a starter that won't turn.
--
-- ENGINE-FREE, so it unit-tests in a bare interpreter (tests/run_tests.lua). This
-- module answers two questions and nothing else:
--     "given the switches and the battery, what is actually lit?"  -> effective()
--     "where do the light sources go, relative to the loco?"       -> emitters()
-- Turning emitters into real IsoLightSources on the map is the client adapter's job
-- (client/Railroader/RR_LightsRender.lua).
--
-- WHY THE BEAM IS A CHAIN OF POINT LIGHTS (verified against the B42 decompile):
-- PZ has two lighting systems. IsoLightSource -- the only one reachable from Lua --
-- is a RADIAL point light on an integer tile: no direction, no cone, no angle (the
-- native addLight() takes only x/y/z/radius/rgb). The real cone light is the "torch"
-- (LightingJNI.updateTorch), which is what a flashlight and a car headlight both are,
-- and LightingJNI.checkLights() only ever walks IsoPlayer.players[] and
-- IsoCell.getVehicles(). Our loco is an IsoAnimal in neither list, and LightingJNI is
-- not exposed to Lua -- so a true cone is IMPOSSIBLE here, not merely awkward.
-- We therefore fake the beam as a row of point lights laid ON THE SPLINE ahead of the
-- nose. Offsets below are ROUTE DISTANCES, not body-frame offsets, on purpose: the
-- beam then bends with the rails through a curve, which is what a real headlight
-- (bolted to the frame, sweeping the outside of the curve) conspicuously does NOT do.
-- We get an arguably better-looking lie than the thing we couldn't have.

-- THE VISIBLE LAMPS -- painted on the locomotive's own texture.
--
-- The IsoLightSource chain above lights the WORLD; it does nothing for the loco's own
-- model, which stays as dark as the night around it. PZ gives a non-vehicle model no
-- emissive channel at all: `animalEffect.frag` hard-clamps a lit model to its own albedo,
-- and the vehicle TextureLights path is a VehicleModelInstance field gated on
-- `effect.isVehicleShader()`. So a headlight has to be BOTH painted and specially shaded.
--
-- WE TRIED IT THE OTHER WAY, TWICE. The lens was a separate world entity carrying a
-- full-bright mesh. That fights the engine on every axis at once -- its own position, its
-- own grid square, its own depth sort -- and it lost: the lamp hung in mid-air off the
-- nose, then buried itself inside the hood, then jumped somewhere new on every toggle.
-- A headlight is part of the locomotive. So now it IS part of the locomotive: the twin
-- sealed-beam lenses are painted into the loco's texture (stamped in 3D, then carried
-- through the shattered UV atlas by a baked Generated-coordinate pass), and they can never
-- be in the wrong place because they are not placed at all.
--
-- Being LIT is then a property of WHICH TEXTURE IS BOUND, and swapping the skin is the one
-- per-instance channel PZ offers from Lua (AnimalVisual.setSkinTextureName +
-- resetModelNextFrame). Three variants -- and the switch position is literally how many of
-- the two sealed beams are burning, which is what the real switch physically does:
--     OFF    -> both lenses dark glass
--     DIM    -> the upper beam lit
--     BRIGHT -> both beams lit
-- The lit lenses are painted in KEY MAGENTA; our shader (42/media/shaders/rr_loco.frag)
-- renders any magenta texel FULL-BRIGHT, ignoring the world lighting. That is what makes
-- the lamp actually bright at midnight rather than merely painted.
--
-- BOTH ENDS of the loco are painted, and both light together. The two ends are
-- geometrically near-identical, so nothing in the mesh says which one is "forward" --
-- lighting only the leading end would be a coin flip. It also halves the number of texture
-- variants and means the reverser never triggers a model rebuild.
