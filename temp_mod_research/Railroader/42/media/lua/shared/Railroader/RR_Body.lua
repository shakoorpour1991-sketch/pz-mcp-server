-- Railroader / RR_Body  -- loco footprint & collider-segment geometry (PURE)
--
-- Engine-free geometry shared by the collider (RR_Collider) and the future
-- "crush zombies" sweep. Given only the loco's render size it yields:
--   * extents(size)         -> in-world length/width/height (tiles)
--   * segmentOffsets(size)  -> signed distances along the travel axis at which to
--                              place collision segments so their SEG_RADIUS circles
--                              overlap into a capsule covering the whole body.
--
-- WHY these numbers (verified, see docs/ENGINE_NOTES.md):
--   The model-script `scale` is ignored on the animal path; the ONLY scale that
--   applies is the animal render transform 1.5 * getAnimalSize()
--   (IsoAnimal.java:2642). So in-world extent = MESH_bbox * 1.5 * size. The MESH
--   bbox is the exported FBX vertex bbox of RR_LocoTest.fbx. LIVE size = 0.7
--   (loco.minSize = maxSize = 0.7 pin getAnimalSize there; the older "0.604" once
--   in these docs is STALE), so the footprint is 17.96 x 3.74 tiles. NOTE the mesh
--   bbox OVERHANGS the visible hull (~15 x 3, the old J-capture): ~1.5 empty tiles
--   per END and ~0.6 per SIDE, which the obstacle sweep trims back to the drawn
--   hull with NOSE_TRIM / WIDTH_TRIM. UPDATE MESH if the mesh changes.
--
-- No engine calls here (Kahlua-safe, unit-testable). Callers read size/pose off
-- the animal and feed the results into the spline.

-- Vertex bbox of the ASSEMBLED locomotive, in mesh units -- carbody PLUS both trucks.
-- Since Task 3.C the shipped meshes are two files (RR_LocoBody.fbx + RR_Truck.fbx placed
-- twice), and RR_LocoBody.fbx alone measures 17.10 x 3.56 x [0.136 .. 4.503]: no wheels, so
-- its box starts above the railhead. Do NOT re-measure this off that file. Everything here
-- describes where the LOCOMOTIVE is -- the footprint, the collider rectangle, the crush
-- sweep, the obstacle gauge -- and the locomotive still has wheels on the rail.
Body.MESH = { long = 17.10, wide = 3.56, tall = 4.503 }   -- long=Y(travel) wide=X tall=Z
Body.RENDER_MULT = 1.5                                    -- IsoAnimal.java:2642

-- TRUCKS (bogies). A locomotive is a RIGID body carried by two trucks, so its pose
-- is the CHORD between two points on the rail, not the tangent at its centre. This
-- is what makes corners look right: our routes follow map rails, which kink by a
-- hard 45 deg at a node, and a centre-tangent pose snaps the whole 15-tile body
-- through that angle in one tick (nose swings off the rails, then the tail does).
-- With a chord the yaw is spread over the wheelbase (the front truck is already
-- round the corner while the rear one isn't), and the body overhangs the curve
-- exactly like a real loco. Spacing = truck-centre to truck-centre as a fraction of
-- body length.
--
-- 0.5556 IS MEASURED OFF THE MESH, and it replaces a 0.61 that was reasoned off the
-- prototype (2026-08-07, Task 3.C). The prototype number was right and applied to the
-- wrong length: 31 ft centres on a ~50 ft FRAME is 0.61, but MESH.long is 17.10 -- the
-- length over the COUPLERS. The mesh puts the centre pins at +/-4.75 (stage2d_truck.py's
-- TRUCK_Y, and tools/split_trucks.py cuts the trucks out around exactly that), so the
-- honest fraction is 2*4.75/17.10 = 0.5556 and the old one placed the chord ends 0.49
-- TILES outside the pins they are supposed to be.
--
-- It never mattered while the trucks were painted onto the carbody -- the error only
-- lengthened the chord slightly, so corners swung over a marginally longer distance and
-- nothing on screen disagreed with anything else. It matters now: RR_Trucks puts a real
-- truck model at each chord end, and half a tile of error is a truck sliding out from
-- under its own frame. Consequence of the fix: the body's yaw now turns over 10.95 tiles
-- of travel instead of 10.95/0.5556*0.61 = 12.02, i.e. corners are slightly quicker.
Body.TRUCK_SPACING_FRAC = 0.5556

-- Half the axle spacing WITHIN one truck, mesh units. The truck rides the rail on two
-- axles at +/- this from its centre pin (stage2d_truck.AXLES = -6.08 and -3.42 about a
-- pin at -4.75), and RR_Truck uses the chord between those two points as the truck's own
-- heading -- for the same reason the body uses the chord between the trucks, one scale
-- down. Also what stops a truck snapping through a route kink in a single tick.
Body.TRUCK_AXLE_HALF = 1.33

-- Per-segment collision radius (tiles) = half the loco width, so a single row of
-- circles forms a capsule as wide as the body. width = collisionSize * size, so
-- KEEP IN SYNC with rr_collider collisionSize in RR_ColliderDefinitions.lua
-- (that type is size 1.0, so collisionSize must equal SEG_RADIUS).
Body.SEG_RADIUS  = 1.6

Body.MAX_SEGMENTS = 16               -- safety cap (per row)

-- Lateral rows across the WIDTH. A single centred row of radius-1.6 circles already
-- spans the full 3.2-tile width IF centred, but in practice the anchor sits slightly
-- off-centre; two rows straddling the centreline guarantee both flanks are covered
-- (a zombie bit the driver through the far side with one row). Rows are placed at
-- +/- ROW_LAT_FACTOR * width from the centreline.
Body.ROWS = 2
Body.ROW_LAT_FACTOR = 0.25           -- rows at +/- quarter-width

-- LATERAL CENTRE BIAS (tiles, + = RIGHT of travel). THE ONE PLACE the body box is
-- re-centred across its width.
-- WHY: the animal ANCHOR (what every pose is built on) is not exactly the drawn hull's
-- centreline -- the mesh's own lateral centre sits a little off the bone, and the animal
-- renders with an isometric shift the RR_Calibrate table corrects per direction. The box
-- itself is symmetric (+/- wid/2 about the anchor), so any anchor-vs-hull offset shows up
-- as a габарит that is NARROWER on one side of the drawn loco than the other -- owner
-- in-game 2026-07-27: "по правому борту габарит немного меньше, чем по левому". Shifting
-- the CENTRE (rather than widening one flank) keeps the box the true body width and just
-- puts it back on the hull.
-- Applied by Body.toLocal (=> contains/crush), Body.rowLaterals (=> collider segments),
-- RR_Collider.ejectIntruders, RR_ObstacleSweep's lateral probes and the U overlay -- so
-- every consumer of "where the loco is, across the rails" agrees.
-- CALIBRATE in-game (live: `RR.Body.LAT_BIAS = 0.25` in the console, then U):
--   press U -> the overlay draws the box CENTRED ON THE HULL plus the sweep's gauge edges
--   (cyan) along both flanks. Nudge LAT_BIAS until the two cyan lines sit equally far off
--   the drawn body sides. + moves the box RIGHT of travel, - moves it LEFT.
-- Bake the settled value here. 0 = box centred on the anchor (pre-2026-07-27 behaviour).

-- CRUSH (Task 1.H): pure geometry + speed policy for running zombies over. The
-- engine sweep (client/RR_Crush) reads size/pose/speed off the loco, calls these
-- to decide who is under the body and what happens to them, then applies the
-- engine effect (knockDown / Kill). No engine calls here -> unit-tested.
--
-- Speed tiers (m/s, |v|) for a body that is STANDING when the loco reaches it,
-- see docs/CRUSH_DESIGN.md:
--   < V_MIN   : nothing (the collider's keep-out clamp already handles a parked
--               or crawling loco -- a standstill must NOT be lethal).
--   V_MIN..V_KILL : knockDown (staggered/floored, chance to become a crawler).
--   V_KILL..V_GORE : lethal (Kill, credited to the driver).
--   >= V_GORE : lethal + gory (Kill with bGory -- extra blood/gibs at speed).
-- Ordered against the vanilla vehicle-hit shape (IsoZombie.postHitByVehicleUpdate-
-- Stance): stagger from ~2, knockdown from ~3.5 -- we sit a touch lower so the loco
-- reads as heavier/deadlier than a car.
--
-- A body that is ALREADY DOWN gets its own, much harsher rule (`downed` argument),
-- because it is in a different place: not against the frame but UNDER it, in the
-- wheels. Below V_KILL the standing tier only floors a zombie, and the floored one
-- used to lie there while the whole 15-tile body rolled over it and then STAND UP
-- INSIDE the hull (owner report 2026-08-02) -- the loco literally driving over a
-- body and leaving it to get up. So: down + any rolling wheel = dead, and only a
-- loco that is actually standing still (< V_ROLL) is harmless to it. This is also
-- what keeps the knockdown tier honest -- a zombie floored at 2 m/s dies to the
-- wheels a moment later unless the fall put it clear of the footprint.
-- The downed kill is ALWAYS the gory one, with no speed tier of its own -- which is
-- also what vanilla does with a car: IsoGameCharacter.onHitByVehicleApplyDamage
-- (:12750-12762) separates `isCrushed = isProne()` exactly as we do and finishes with
-- the ONE-argument Kill(killer), i.e. Kill(killer, null, true, null) -- isGory TRUE at
-- any impact speed. Speed scales an impact against the frame; a wheel does not need
-- help. (This is also the answer to "why is there no death sound when we roll over a
-- body" -- see RR_Crush, which pairs the gore with the vanilla run-over foley.)
