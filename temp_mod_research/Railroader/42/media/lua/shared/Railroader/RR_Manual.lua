--***********************************************************************
-- Railroader / RR_Manual  -- the engineer's notebook: THE MOD'S MANUAL, carried
-- in the pocket of the man who took the Railroader profession.
--
-- The Railroader starts with two things. One is the photo album (RR_Album) --
-- who he was; that one is pure flavour. This is the other, and it is the
-- opposite: a working CRIB SHEET. Eight pages, ordered by what the survivor
-- needs first -- where the 800 stands and how to get in it, how to crank it,
-- how to move it and stop it, how to read the control stand, signals and lights,
-- fuel and battery, switches and what hitting things costs, derailment and the
-- cab.
--
-- AND ONE NINTH PAGE THAT TEACHES NOTHING: the supporters (Task 2.G). It sits
-- LAST for exactly that reason -- the ordering rule is soonest-needed nearest
-- the front, and a thank-you is needed never. It carries only the handles of
-- people who agreed to be printed here (docs/SUPPORTERS.md is the roster and
-- records who has and has not agreed); the heading is translated, the handles
-- are byte-identical in EN and RU because a handle is spelled the way its owner
-- spells it.
--
-- HOUSE STYLE, DECIDED BY THE OWNER (2026-07-29) AND NOT TO BE DRIFTED FROM:
-- ONE FACT PER LINE. No anecdotes, no dated entries, no second handwriting, no
-- character in it at all. The earlier cut was written in the voice of a 1968
-- fireman taking notes off an engineer named Hank, with the apocalypse facts
-- arriving in a second hand -- it read well and taught slowly, which is the
-- wrong trade for the one item a player opens when he does not know which key
-- starts the engine. Keep new lines terse, keep them true, and put the thing
-- the player needs soonest nearest the front.
--
-- PURE LUA, NO ENGINE DEPENDENCIES -- unit-tested in a bare interpreter
-- (tests/run_tests.lua). The client adapter (RR_ManualPlace) does the engine
-- work: create the item and write the pages into it.
--
-- WHERE THE TEXT LIVES: not here. Each page is one translation key in
-- Translate/{EN,RU}/IG_UI.json, with "\n" (a literal backslash-n) for line
-- breaks -- the convention vanilla itself uses for multi-line strings (see
-- Print_Text.json + ISReadABook:displayPrintMedia, which gsubs exactly this).
-- Manual.unescape() is that gsub. Consequence worth knowing: the pages are
-- written into the item at character creation, so they are baked into the save
-- in the language the game was in at that moment -- which is what a handwritten
-- notebook should do anyway.
--
-- THE FIT RULES (MAX_LINES/MAX_COLS) ARE NOT DECORATION. The vanilla journal UI
-- (ISUIWriteJournal, opened from ISInventoryPaneContextMenu with lineNumber=15
-- and a 350px window) hands the page to an ISTextEntryBox with setMaxLines(15)
-- and setMaxTextLength(15*80). Text past that is not scrolled to -- it is simply
-- not seen. So the unit tests wrap every authored page, in EVERY language, and
-- fail if one would spill. ulen() counts CHARACTERS, not bytes: the Russian
-- pages are UTF-8 and #s would over-count them by two.
