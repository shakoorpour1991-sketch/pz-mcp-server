-- Railroader / RR_Spline
-- THE CORE: distance along a route -> world pose (x, y, z + heading).
--
-- This is the simple, testable heart of the mod. Everything else (the entity,
-- the cars, the player seating) is built on top of this one function. It has NO
-- engine dependencies so it can be unit-tested in a bare Lua interpreter.
--
-- Interpolation is currently LINEAR (piecewise straight segments). This means
-- heading is constant within a segment and changes discretely at nodes -- which
-- is exactly right for rails laid as straight runs between hand-placed nodes,
-- and keeps the math trivially verifiable. Catmull-Rom smoothing can replace
-- sampleLinear later without changing the public API or callers.

--     heading,            -- forward angle, radians, math convention (0=+X, CCW)

--     distance }          -- the normalized distance actually sampled

-- bodyPose: the pose of a RIGID body of wheelbase 2*hw whose two trucks ride the
-- rail at (d - hw) and (d + hw). Position is the midpoint of the trucks; heading is
-- the CHORD between them, not the tangent at d.
--
-- WHY (the corner problem): map rails kink by a hard 45 deg at a node. With a
-- centre-tangent pose the heading is a step function -- a 15-tile loco snaps through
-- 45 deg in a single tick, throwing its nose off the new rails and then its tail off
-- the old ones. The chord makes the heading a CONTINUOUS function of d: it rotates
-- gradually while the front truck is past the kink and the rear one isn't, i.e. over
-- the whole wheelbase of travel, and the body overhangs the corner the way a real
-- long-frame loco does. Residual corner-cutting of the centre is ~hw*sin(theta/2),
-- inherent to any rigid body on a kinked path (a fillet on the polyline would
-- shrink it further -- see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
--
-- hw = 0 (or nil) degrades exactly to sample(), so callers without a body keep the
-- old behaviour. Returns the same pose shape as sample(); .distance/.seg/.t refer to
-- the CENTRE (they parameterize travel, and the chord midpoint is not on the rail).

-- truckPoses: where the two TRUCKS of that rigid body are, and which way each one
-- points -- the data bodyPose already computes internally and then throws away.
--
-- Position is the rail point at (d +/- hw): the same two points bodyPose takes its
-- chord between, so a truck placed here sits exactly under the centre pin of the body
-- riding on it, by construction, with no third opinion about where the body is.
--
-- HEADING is NOT the tangent at that point. A route is a polyline that kinks by a hard
-- 45 degrees at a node, so the tangent is a step function and a truck posed on it would
-- snap through 45 degrees in one tick -- the very defect bodyPose exists to keep off the
-- carbody. A real truck cannot do that either: it rides on two axles, and its yaw is the
-- chord between them. So each truck gets the same treatment as the body, one scale down:
-- the chord between the rail points at (its own distance +/- axleHalf). At a kink that
-- turns the step into a ramp spread over the axle spacing (~2.8 tiles of travel).
--
-- axleHalf = 0 (or nil) degrades to the raw tangent, which is what the old snap was.

-- Returns two poses shaped like sample(): { x, y, z, dirX, dirY, heading, distance },
-- front first (the +hw end), then rear.
