-- Railroader / RR_Ride  -- player seating + MANUAL DRIVE controls (Task 1.D)
--
-- Vanilla B42 has NO rideable system. This pins the player onto a moving custom
-- entity (camera tracks it, walking input blocked) using only Lua + verified
-- engine methods -- no BaseVehicle. Proven in the vertical slice; Task 1.D adds
-- the driver's controls on top of the same pin.
--
-- Seating (each grounded in decompiled B42):
--   * IsoPlayer:setBlockMovement(true)  -> freeze input-driven walking (exactly
--     what vanilla does while the world map / on-screen keyboard is open).
--   * Each tick, snap player x/y/z to the entity's current pose; camera follows.
--   * animal:setCollidable(false) so its separate() doesn't shove us off the seat.
--
-- Driving (writes the entity's RR_Drive control inputs; physics runs in
-- RR_TrainEntity.onTick):
--   E  board/leave (like a vehicle) -- see below.   L/K  legacy debug mount/dismount
--   W  throttle +1 notch    S  throttle -1 notch   (0=idle .. 8=Run 8)
--   R  reverser cycle F -> N -> R   (only near a standstill -- can't reverse a
--                                    rolling loco; realistic). Also turns the DRIVER
--                                    round: his default facing is the direction the
--                                    handle selects (travelFacing / Drive.faceSign).
--   Space (HOLD)  independent air brake  (ramps to full; release to release)
--   RMB (HOLD)  look toward the cursor (swings the driver's facing + vision cone);
--               release = face along the rails, the way the reverser points.
--               Reproduces vanilla free-look, which setBlockMovement disables (the
--               engine skips input turning while movement is blocked).
-- Mounting NO LONGER auto-departs -- the player drives (replaces old G auto-run;
-- G stays as a debug cruise when nobody is seated).
--
-- ON A CONTROLLER (Task 2.H): the same controls, on the DPad plus three buttons --
-- see client/RR_RideJoypad.lua and shared/RR_JoyMap.lua. Nothing about the cab is
-- re-implemented there: the pad calls Ride.control below, exactly as the keys do,
-- and its brake is OR-ed into the same e.brakeInput (as a LATCH, not a hold).
--
-- E-key board/leave (vehicle-like, the primary control):
--   * On foot, within MOUNT_REACH tiles OF THE LOCO'S DRAWN HULL (not its centre --
--     the body is 15 tiles long): board it (mountNearest gated by distance so E
--     elsewhere falls through to vanilla interact).
--   * Seated & stopped: step off -- placed a little to the SIDE of the loco by the
--     cab door, always on the CAMERA-FACING side (bottom of the iso screen) so the
--     body isn't hidden behind the hood.
--   * Seated & MOVING: cut throttle to idle + full service brake, then auto-step-off
--     the instant the loco comes to rest (pendingDismount, resolved in onTick).
