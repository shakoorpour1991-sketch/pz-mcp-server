--***********************************************************************
-- Railroader / RR_MP  -- the multiplayer guard
--
-- WHAT THIS IS. Railroader has no server half: `server/Railroader/` is still empty,
-- and every system that moves the locomotive, poses the collider chain, runs zombies
-- over, smashes obstacles, places switch stands and bulk tanks or throws points lives
-- in `client/` and runs on the local machine. In singleplayer that IS the world. On a
-- connected client it is not: the same code would
--     * run the approach spawn on EVERY client -> several K&L 800s, one per player,
--       each one a locally-added IsoAnimal the others cannot see;
--     * fight the server for the loco's position (animals are server-authoritative,
--       and we setX/setY it 60 times a second);
--     * destroy world objects and kill zombies with no authority to do either;
--     * write the spawn flag, the diesel reserves and the switch positions into a
--       per-client global ModData table that is never transmitted.
-- So on a client the mod STANDS DOWN: nothing spawns, nothing ticks, no context-menu
-- entries, and the vanilla V / F / walk-to keys are left alone instead of being claimed.
--
-- WHO IS ALLOWED TO RUN IT. Singleplayer, and the co-op HOST. The host's game process
-- is the one running the server, so his client is the closest thing we have to authority
-- -- that is the "SP/host" the Workshop page claims. It is still not verified in-game and
-- remote players will not see his locomotive; the warning below says so.
--
-- HOW WE TELL THEM APART (verified against the B42 decompile, not guessed):
--   isClient()      = GameClient.client   -- TRUE for any connected client, the co-op
--                                            host included (he connects to his own server)
--   isServer()      = GameServer.server   -- the server process only
--   CoopServer:isRunning()                -- CoopMaster.isRunning(): MY process launched
--                                            the co-op server. Locally authoritative, and
--                                            the check vanilla's own InviteFriends.lua uses.
--   isCoopHost()    = GameClient.connection.isCoopHost -- fallback ONLY. The server sets it
--                                            from `connections.size() == 1` (LoginPacket),
--                                            i.e. the FIRST player to join a dedicated
--                                            server gets it too. Used just in case the
--                                            CoopServer table is missing.
--
-- OVERRIDE, from the in-game console (session-only, nothing persisted):
--     RR.MP.set(true)    -- run it anyway; you accept the duplicates and the desync
--     RR.MP.set(false)   -- stand down even in singleplayer
--     RR.MP.set("auto")  -- back to the rule above
--     RR.MP.report()     -- what it decided and why
